## Frontend Testing Rules (React)

### Testing Stack

- Use Vitest or Jest with React Testing Library.
- Use MSW to mock network requests in tests.

### Principles

- Test behavior, not implementation details.
- Arrange-Act-Assert structure; clear naming.
- Keep tests deterministic; mock timers and random.

### Component Tests

- Render components with providers (Chakra theme, Refine context) via custom render helper.
- Test accessibility (roles, labels) and user flows with `user-event`.
- Avoid asserting internal state; assert DOM and side effects.

### Hooks Tests

- Test hooks with `renderHook`; mock Refine data hooks where needed.
- Cover loading, success, and error states.

### E2E Pointer

- Use Playwright or Cypress for E2E; mock backend where feasible.
